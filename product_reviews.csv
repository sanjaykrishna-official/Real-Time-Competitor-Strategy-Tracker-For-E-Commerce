Design
One of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14.

Display
The iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.

Performance
The iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market. The A16 Bionic chip is up to 20% faster than the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14.

Camera
The iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.

Battery life
The iPhone 15 has the same battery life as the iPhone 14. This means that you can expect to get around a day of use on a single charge. Overall The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade over the iPhone 14.

New design with rounded edges
More powerful A16 Bionic chip found in 14 pro
New 48-megapixel main camera

First of it looks very very prime quality and nicely fit in your hands. I am an android user still I don't face issue at the time of operating. In India you have to download required apps from app store free of cost. Apple store not available in India. You can use two sim , one physical micro sim and other esim. Conversion of physical micro sim to esim is very easy and happen in just two hours from your home. But after conversion sms service restricted for 24 hours as per guidelines if TRAI. No issue of connectivity if you have good network strength of your desired operator. Very crispy screen gives no strain on your eyes. Battery life is awesome , 1 one day for heavy user and 2 days for light user. Smooth performance of IOS system, no lags ,no glitches , not a single problem when you get to use. Sound is also very big but very crystal clear. Value is on high side, so though it is very good in all aspects, many people may find it very difficult to purchase .

 iPhone XR to iPhone 15
Reviewed in India on 7 October 2023

Just made the transition and here‚Äôs my POV on the first ~2 month of use

Pros
- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants
- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I‚Äôm transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here
- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it‚Äôs spotless
- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA
- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome
- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.
- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone
- Apples approach on Security!
- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawless

Cons
- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone‚Ä¶ including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up‚Ä¶.. works like a charm
- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchases

Industry memes
- USB C : honestly don‚Äôt give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It‚Äôs just a mode of charging for me and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much
- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!
- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?
- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I‚Äôve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for texting

Tips of managing battery health
- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don‚Äôt need back ground refresh
- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up
- I charge my phone only using a power bank not direct wired or wireless charging
- Don‚Äôt let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%
- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service
- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section
- I don‚Äôt use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc
- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I‚Äôm recommending above

Vendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.

‚Ä¶.. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience

Everyone know about pros , let's only talk about cons
Battery : worst than I expect . Many says it is iOS 17 behind poor battery life . Hardly 3-4 he if you travelling and your network changes frequently .. worst than my android devices .
Performance : no doubt in performance , it's the best in the industry ,
Camera : undoubtably very good in camera dipartment but I hardly take photos üòÅ
iOS : verry smooth and many good things are missing . Call recording , call pick up haptic , smart dial and many more little but verry important feature ..
Many youtuber says there is no such use of dynamic island but listen to me it is verry usefull and looking cool too
Price : obviously it's not value for money but it's far better than 13 and 14 launch price which is same . Although this time iPhone 15 far better than 15 pro

Waiting for Qualcomm and Mediatek windows laptops. Apple is too greedy. 20k for 8gb extra RAM that is daylight robbery.
